doomsday_trainer
================

A simple Python program for testing your ability to mentally calculate 
the day of the week for any date using the Doomsday Algorithm. To learn 
more about the algorithm see: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule

The main feature is that when you guess incorrectly, the program will walk 
you through the algorithm to show you where things went awry.

The program picks dates at random, but you are more likely to see dates in
nearby years.

Installation
------------
The program has been tested with Python 2.7 only.

Just download and run:

        python doomsday_trainer.py

Multiple Trials
---------------
If you want to run more than one trial, enter the desired number of trials as
the first argument, e.g. for 5 trials run:

        python doomsday_trainer.py 5
