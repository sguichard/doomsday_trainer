doomsday_trainer
================

A simple Python program for testing your ability to calculate the day of the
week for any date using the Doomsday Algorithm. To learn more about the
algorithm see: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule

The main feature of the program is that when you guess incorrectly, the program
will walk you through the algorithm so that you can determine where you
errored.

The program picks dates at random, but you are more likely to see dates in
nearby years.

Installation
------------
The program has been tested with Python 2.7 only.

Just download and run:

        python doomsday_trainer.py

Multiple Trials
---------------
If you want to run more than one trial, enter the desired number of trials as
the first argument, e.g. for 5 trials run:

        python doomsday_trainer.py 5
